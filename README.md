# Hashmap_pred
Final project for cisc 220 which uses amateur hashing and input files to predict text using hashmaps.


# About
    Final project in which the files filled by me are hashnode.cpp and hashmap.cpp (the main functionality files) all other work is 
    attributed to Professor Yarrington at the University of Delaware.
    
    Works by assosciating "keys" or words including punctuation with the "values" of the words that come after them. 
    Keys may have more than one value, and the map may be rehashed if needed.
    
    Hashing algorithms are for-fun mostly by me with likely no mathematical signifigance, but were fun to think about.
# Usage
    By cloning and editing "mainhash.cpp" you can use pretty much any text format as input with prett self explanatory syntax, 
    but note some xml files and other types may break the program. The hard cap for map size is also 7879, just to avoid 
    memory explosion.
    
# Samples
    Any files affixed with "out" are output files from the program, but to avoid any legal issues some files such as works by
    Dr suess and the entire sherlock holmes series had to be omitted.
