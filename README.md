# Hashmap_pred
Final project for cisc 220 which uses amateur hashing and input files to predict text using hashmaps.


# About
    -Final project in which the files filled by me are hashnode.cpp and hashmap.cpp (the main functionality files) all other work is 
    attributed to Professor Yarrington at the University of Delaware.
    -Works by assosciating "keys" or words including punctuation with the "values" of the words that come after them. 
    Keys may have more than one value, and the map may be rehashed if needed.
    -Hashing algorithms are for-fun mostly by me with likely no mathematical signifigance, but were fun to think about.
